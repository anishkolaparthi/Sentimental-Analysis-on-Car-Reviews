The objective is to analyze the sentiments expressed in these reviews to identify areas for product improvement and derive actionable insights that can direct the improvement of the automobile product by comprehending the feelings expressed by customers to classify the reviews as either positive or negative.

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning each input data point is paired with the correct output. 
During training, the model learns the mapping between inputs and outputs so that it can make predictions on new, unseen data. 
This approach is commonly used for tasks such as classification and regression.
Neural networks are a class of models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. 
They consist of interconnected nodes, called neurons, organized into layers. 
Each neuron receives input, performs a computation, and passes its output to the next layer.
Through a process called backpropagation, neural networks learn from data by adjusting the weights of connections between neurons to minimize the difference between predicted and actual outputs.
We used both Supervised models and Neural Networks. The latter also comes under Supervised in a way as we used training data with labels to build the network.
